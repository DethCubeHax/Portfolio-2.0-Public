    "content": "I finally created my first portfolio website and published a blog on it!\nIt truly was quite the experience, with my second time taking a deep dive into the realms of MERN (well technically, only RN because this doesn't have any database, yet).\nNeedless to say, I wanted this site to truly reflect my abilities as accurately as possible, as well as my artistic ability. Every single color palette, layout and design choice was made by me, every animation, effect and JavaScript written from scratch.\nOf course I encountered tons of bugs along the way, especially with as complex of a dynamic background, transitions and various effects as shown here, but every single time, my initial frustration and head-bashing was quickly replaced with a surge of elation. And it just kept getting better and better as page after page, I knew I was approaching the day.\nThat day is today. DethCubeHax, signing out."
