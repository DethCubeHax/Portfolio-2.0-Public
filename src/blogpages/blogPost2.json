  "content": "Having way too much 'free' time than I should for a penultimate university student with his finals approaching, I decided to add a fancy new Terminal to the mix, and totally did NOT do this by hand ðŸ’€... Having said that though, this console will now allow visitors to ask questions about me or navigating the site, as well as some other additions for the interested to find out ;). \n It features some really cool stuff, such as my age in years, correct to 10 decimal places since my birthday, as well as counts of my projects, work-experiences, publications and the like. Naturally having such *infinite* time at my disposal, of course I made the wise decision of hardcoding these counts for the time being because I do not hav the time, nor the energy to pull off a dynamic system to do this.\nIf only there was an easier way to impress the hiring team... As they say, life could be a dream, but it is not.\n DethCubeHax, signing out."
